        <p>Balto (1919 – March 14, 1933) was a Siberian Husky and sled dog belonging to musher and breeder Leonhard Seppala.
        He achieved fame when he reportedly led a team of sled dogs driven by Gunnar Kaasen on the final leg of the 1925 serum run to Nome, in which diphtheria antitoxin was transported from Anchorage, Alaska, to Nenana, Alaska, by train and then to Nome by dog sled to combat an outbreak of the disease.</p>
        <p>In January 1925 doctors realized that a potentially deadly diphtheria epidemic was poised to sweep through Nome's young people. The only serum that could stop the outbreak was in Anchorage, Alaska.
        The engine of the only aircraft that could quickly deliver the medicine was frozen and would not start.
        After considering all of the alternatives, officials decided to move the medicine via multiple dog sled teams.
        The serum was transported by train from Anchorage to Nenana, where the first musher embarked as part of a relay aimed at delive
        ring the serum to Nome.
        More than 20 mushers took part, facing a blizzard with -23 °F (−31 °C) temperatures and strong winds. News coverage of the event was worldwide.</p>
        <p>On February 2, 1925 the Norwegian Gunnar Kaasen, a family friend of Leonhard Seppala driving a team of Seppala's dogs which he had left behind in case they would be needed, led by Fox and including Balto among others,[5] was handed off the serum package by Charlie Olson in Bluff.
        They arrived in Port Safety shortly thereafter, where the final leg of the relay was to begin.
        The final team and its driver, Ed Rohn, had believed Kaasen and the relay were halted in nearby Solomon due to inclement weather, and so were asleep when Kaasen and Balto made it to this final relay point – Kaasen decided to continue on, in order to save time it would take to change sleds and hitch up a new team.
        He traveled the remaining 25 miles to Nome, and arrived at Front Street at 5:30 AM. All ampules of the antitoxin were intact, and Kaasen handed them over to be thawed for use by mid-day.</p>
